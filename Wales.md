Wales Study Abroad 2022!

![image](wales.jpg)

I had an unbeleivable time in the UK studying computer architecture this summer. The classes were held at Swansea University, and taught by A&M professors.

 I already find myself missing the "tube", full englishes, watching rugby in the pubs, and Tesco. Hopefully Ill return to the beaches of Rhosilli sooner than later, but til then, I can enjoy the friendships I made on my adventure. 

For our weekend trips, we went to
*Cardiff, Capital of Wales
*Snowdonia to hike mount Snowden
*Cambridge, where we visited the ARM headquarters
*london
*LOTS and lots of castles


The classes I took were ECEN 350, computer architecture, and ECEN 469, advanced computer architecture. I learned how to design an ARM V8 CPU from scratch, along with the memory hiearchy and assembly that comes with that. The lab and class were amazing from the small class sizes and 2 professors for lab.

Whats Next?
Now that I know the high level(C++) and the low level(computer architecture) of a computer, I want to learn the middle level(OS and compile) to get a complete understanding. Im taking CSCE 313 that will help with this, but Im always learning on my own as well.

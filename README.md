Hi, Im Benjamin Willey, a junior Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M. 

This website is mainly for fun, but also, its for learning and experimenting.

Short term goals I want to achieve
 
 > learn to make commits/pulls to the github repository from my terminal
 
 > Make more interactable features. Think Games and APIs

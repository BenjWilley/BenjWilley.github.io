Welcome, I'm Benjamin Willey, a junior Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M. 

This website is mainly for fun, but also, it's for learning and experimenting.

Short term website goals I want to achieve
 
 > Practice making commits/pulls to the github repository from my terminal
 
 > Make more interactable features. Think Games and APIs

> Github uses markdown, a simplified HTML, but I would like to encorporate other languages.
